# Matrices as a normed space

In this file we provide the following non-instances on matrices, using the elementwise norm:

* `matrix.semi_normed_group`
* `matrix.normed_group`
* `matrix.normed_space`

These are not declared as instances because there are several natural choices for defining the norm
of a matrix.
